This is skeleton development for your BitTorrent (BT) client. 

Included Files and Purpose

bt_client.c   :   Main file where the control loop lives
bt_setup.c    :   Contains setup code, such as parsing arguments
bencode.c     :   Code for parsing bencoded torrent files
bt_lib.c      :   Code for core functionality of bt

bt_setup.h    :   Header file for setup
bencode.h     :   Header file for bencode
bt_lib.h      :   Header file for bt_lib

Suggested Additional Files [and headers]

bt_io.c[.h]   :   File for handing input output
bt_sock.c[.h] :   File for handling socket and network issues

parsetorrent().used to parse the .torrent for any particular file to be downloaded and retrieves

Acceptpeer()--- to accept connections from the peers

Connection().establishes connection between the peers on the given port numbers and identifies if handshake is established. Sending messages and reading the messages from the sender and receiver peer is also observed in the handshake.

Getpeerhandshake().for connection establishment using the sha1,peer id and 20 byte message containing .BitTorrent Protocol. and .19.. Symmetric handshake is established by this function when both sender and receiver use these messages.

Initialize_socket().For establishing socket connections between the peers.

Implemented:
Aimed to establish 1S-1N connection.
Parsing of .torrent file is done.
Handshake is done partially.
bt-client.log file includes the entire logging functionality done.
It includes the details of ports to which peers are connected at what time and the pieces that are sent.

Entire code for logging and various message types is done.
Do consider to have a look at them.
